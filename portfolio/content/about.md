Hi! I'm Anish and I like to build things.

I'm currently working on enterprise ai @ Scale AI and a scout for a16z.

Previously:

Studied computer science and robotics at the University of Pennsylvania
Co-founded Chatter (acq.) and built developer tooling for AI
Founder in the summer '23 batch of Y Combinator
Always excited to talk about startups, robotics, ai/ml, and food!
